## Overview
Frontend mentor is a great companion for learning frontend development. This challenge was TRICKY as it had to be done with GRID and this was my first time using GRID and i didnt had the figma or sketch files but im happy that i could make it as realistic as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size


## My process
I first went on to design my own mockup of the design using figma and then wrote mobile first css and then made it responsive using grid.
### Built with

- CSS GRID

### Built with

### What I learned

I understood css grid very well while creating this project. I learned how css grid area can do wonders.

### Continued development

From now on im going to create mockups first because believe me it saves a lot of time and the develoment becomes faster.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me for buildin the mockup . I really liked this pattern of building mockups first and will use it going forward.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand the css grid area. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
